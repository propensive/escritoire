_Escritoire_ is a simple library for printing tabular data in monospaced fonts,
typically for use in console applications. Tables can be displayed in a number
of styles.

Particular care has been given to ensuring a table will render to a maximum
width, and columns can be controlled to scale dynamically according to their
content and other parameters.
